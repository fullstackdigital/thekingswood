      For sit-down gatherings we offer communal style dining, with shared
      platters of food laid out on the table for friends and family to tuck into
      together. For a standing (non sit-down) event we offer grazing tables and
      canapes. The Kingswood is available for private events for up to
      twenty-eight (28) guests sit down or up to sixty (60) guests cocktail
      style (non sit-down).

      We require a credit card as security for all groups larger than 7 people.
      Your card will not be charged at the time of booking. However, we reserve
      the right to charge a no-show fee of $15 per person to this card, if the
      confirmed booking numbers change within 24 hours prior to your attendance.
