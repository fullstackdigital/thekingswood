      For sit-down gatherings we offer communal style dining, with shared
      platters of food laid out on the table for friends and family to tuck into
      together. For a standing (non sit-down) event we offer grazing tables and
      canapes. The Kingswood is available for private events for up to
      twenty-eight (28) guests sit down or up to sixty (60) guests cocktail
