      <p className="text">
        For Group Bookings (party of 8 or more) The Kingswood requires credit
        card details to hold the booking (a deposit will not be taken). Group
        Bookings will be contacted in the days leading up to the reservation by
        email and by phone call. You may cancel the booking anytime up to 24
        hours prior to your dining time. If we do not receive a confirmation or
        cancellation email from you and in the event of a no-show your credit
        card will be charged at $15 per person based on the party size.
      </p>
      <p className="text">
        You may book the entire venue for a Private Event. The Kingswood is
        available for private events for up to thirty (30) guests sit down or up
        to sixty (60) guests cocktail style (non sit-down).
      </p>
      <p className="text">
        For sit-down gatherings we offer communal style dining, with shared
        platters of food laid out on the table for friends and family to tuck
        into together. For a standing (non sit-down) event we offer grazing
        tables and canapes. To lock in a Private Event a 20% deposit will be
        required. The amount will be determined by the type of event.
