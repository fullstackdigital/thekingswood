      At lunch, expect a top sambo, smattering of share plates, or a plate du
      jour. Or if you are heading to the park, grab a picnic box full of goodies
      on the way. Dinner will offer a wider range of dishes and a creative
      combination of happy snacks and sweet endings. The menu is energetic and
      always changing, including plenty of options for vegetarians, vegans, and
      gluten free diets.
